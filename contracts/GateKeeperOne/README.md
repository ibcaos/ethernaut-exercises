// A brief explanation of the challenge:

// First step: We need to call the contract from another contract. In doing so, we can bypass the 
// msg.sender != tx.origin condition.

// Second step: It's necessary to calculate the amount of gas for invoking the function. In my scenario, I used a multiple of 8191 because we need to 
// obtain a modulus of 0 using 8191 as the divisor. I also send a multiple and the amount of gas required to hit the GAS opcode. Once the GAS opcode is encountered,
// the value is stored in memory awaiting a subsequent check.

// Third step: Several 'require' conditions need to be addressed.
// The first line verifies: uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) == uint16(uint64(_gateKey)). Analyzing this, 
// we notice that both sides of the equation should match. The difference lies in the number of bytes each integer type handles. 
// Since the smaller type is uint16, the last 16 bytes should be identical.
// The second line verifies: uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey). The smaller type here is uint32, so it will consider the last 4 bytes. However, since they must differ, 
// we can exploit the larger type's 64-byte size and the fact that our dataKey parameter passed to the function is of type bytes8. By setting a value, for instance, 1 in the dataKey,
// uint32 won't capture it, and we can therefore bypass this require statement.
// The third line is the most critical because it dictates the value we should craft, given that it retrieves tx.origin. In this scenario, as we have a uint16 on the right-hand side 
// after type-casting tx.origin, we're left with the last 16 bits. This shouldn't pose any issues, and one could say it behaves similarly to the first line.
